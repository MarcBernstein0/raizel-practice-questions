    "Public and Its Problems, which expressed a fear of the insufficiency of public discourse for the\n",

    "contents were often trivial and sensational. A nation of newspaper readers did not guarantee an\n",
    "informed public equipped to make measured, considered decisions at the polls; rather, the\n",
    "public's information and opinions were tainted by the pecuniary interests of the advertisers and\n",
    "sponsors who funded their news sources.4\n",
    " Dewey, who taught Robert Lynd at Columbia\n",

    "“'News,'” Dewey explained in The Public, “signifies something which has just happened,\n",
    "and which is new because it deviates from the old and regular.”6 Middletown and the Muncie\n",
    "Post-Democrat were two parallel purveyors of “the news,” each with a different perspective on\n",
    "“the old and regular.” As sociologists who distanced themselves from journalism, the Lynds'\n",
    "medium was new in itself: an impartial, expert opinion on social trends in an industrializing\n",
    "small city. As for their message, the Lynds reported that over the past thirty years, business\n",
    "interests had effectively consigned working class Hoosiers to an impotent politics and a barren\n",
    "culture-- and because Middletown represented the country at large, its residents were stand-ins\n",
    "for average Americans nationwide. In contrast, Dale's vision of the news fit neatly within the\n",
    "realm of traditional journalism. Unlike the Lynds, Dale maintained faith that the newspaper\n",
    "could speak truth to power without crumbling under the weight of advertisers' agendas. As the\n",
    "editor of a local politically-minded weekly, Dale made it his business to report events that\n",
    "disrupted civic values and warn his community of eminent threats to their liberties. In the mid1920s, the Klan rose to power in Muncie. While Dale scribbled urgently about the KKK, the\n",

    "Igo explains in The Averaged American, “The Lynds’ quarry was not the problematic or\n",
    "particular but the normal and the whole, and the scope of their conclusions was much more\n",
    "sweeping than that of any other contemporary survey.”7\n",
    "To accomplish this goal, the Lynds drew inspiration less from social surveyors than from\n",
    "anthropologists. In a private notation, Robert wrote that his intention in writing Middletown was\n",
    "to occupy the role of “naive observer” and thus “look at the life of a city objectively.” This was\n",

    "Illinois, and Robert, of Indiana. Robert even conceded that “the ideal person for this job w’d\n",

    "neighbors with the same detachment that their English contemporary A. R. Radcliffe-Brown held\n",
    "in his study of the “fundamental human activities” of his Aboriginal subjects in Australia.9\n",
    "Taking a page from Radcliffe-Brown’s work, Middletown boiled down “all the things people do”\n",
    "into six categories: “Getting a living. Making a home. Training the young. Using leisure in\n",
    "various forms of play, art, and so on. Engaging in religious practices. Engaging in community\n",
    "activities.” The Lynds acknowledged the distaste that a reader might have for discussing their\n",
    "own lifestyles with the same dispassion and candor typically reserved for “an Arunta village in\n",
    "central Australia,” but asserted that this approach was necessary to gain a “clearer vision” of\n",

    "contemporary society: “Nothing can be more enlightening than to gain precisely the degree of\n",
    "objectivity and perspective with which we view ‘savage’ people.”10\n",
    "The Lynds committed to studying Muncie because by their calculations, it was the locus\n",
    "of American normalcy. In the introduction to Middletown, the sociologists explained their two\n",
    "primary criteria for choosing a model city: it should be “as representative as possible of\n",
    "contemporary American life,” and also “compact and homogeneous enough to be manageable in\n",
    "such a total-situation study.” To achieve the former qualification, the Lynds outlined seven\n",
    "subcategories their subject city must meet: a temperate climate; a rapid rate of economic growth\n",
    "to insure “a plentiful assortment of the growing pains accompanying contemporary social\n",
    "change”; an industrial culture centered on “high-speed machine production”; the absence of a\n",
    "single, dominating plant; a local, self-contained artistic life, not like a college town that might\n",
    "import music and lectures; the absence of “any outstanding particularities or acute local\n",
    "problems” that would nullify its representativeness; and finally, a geographic location within\n",
    "“that common-denominator of America, the Middle West.”11 The summation of these criteria\n",
    "yields a vision of “contemporary American life” to be one of a local, independent people\n",
    "rehashing their customs and traditions under the shadow of industrial transformation. This vision\n",
    "follows Robert Lynd’s personal history and previous pursuits-- in 1922, while serving as a\n",
    "student preacher in the Standard Oil workers’ camp in Elk Basin, Wyoming, he published a\n",

    "of the People toward Them,” and was intended to analyze and aid Protestant churches’ responses to industrial\n",
    "life-- a small, specific focus not unlike those of the social survey projects of Addams, Du Bois, and Kellogg\n",
    "5\n",
    "For the Lynds, American normalcy in the 1920s meant a culture reckoning with the forces of\n",
    "urbanization, industrialized labor, and capitalist consumerism.\n",
    "However, this vision of normalcy comes into conflict when we consider the ramifications\n",
    "of the Lynds’ second criterion in choosing a city, namely the compactness and homogeneity\n",
    "necessary for it to be manageable as the subject of their study. The authors defined this\n",
    "qualification of manageability with three subcategories: a population between 25,00 and 50,000\n",
    "as per the 1920 census; geographical and economic self-containedness, i.e. the exclusion of\n",
    "satellite cities; and “a small Negro and foreign-born population.” The Lynds explained their\n",
    "rationale for this last category as pragmatic: “Instead of being forced to handle two major\n",
    "variables, racial change and cultural change, the field staff was enabled to concentrate upon\n",
    "cultural change.”13\n",
    "While the authors acknowledged that such a “homogeneous, native-born population...is\n",
    "unusual in an American industrial city,” they did not consider two significant ramifications of\n",
    "representing such an aberrant town as the paradigm of normalcy. First, the Lynds omitted the fact\n",
    "that Muncie’s homogeneity was unusual not only in the United States, but especially so in the\n",
    "“common-denominator of America,” where its 88 percent “old stock” population was higher than\n",
    "any other city of its size in the Midwest apart from Robert Lynd’s birthplace, New Albany,\n",
    "Indiana. Muncie’s typicality was rooted more deeply in nostalgia than in data-- a predominantly\n",
    "discussed above. When the Lynds produced a very different manuscript in Middletown, the ISRR refused to\n",
    "publish it, but did release it to its authors who found a willing publisher in Alfred Harcourt. See Igo, 30-35.\n",
    "In The Origins of American Social Science, Dorothy Ross explains that the Rockefellers funded social\n",
    "science projects in the 1920s to combat the criticism that their industrial capitalism frequently garnered. They\n",
    "were careful, however, to tow a narrow line that Middletown apparently crossed: “[The Rockefellers] wanted to\n",
    "help solve social problems in a way that would spare the family name controversy and would spare the country\n",

    "that the Lynds intended to deconstruct, and better portrayed in works of fiction like Sinclair\n",
    "Lewis’s 1920 Main Street and 1922 Babbitt than in reality. Second, the Lynds’ separation of\n",
    "“racial change” and “cultural change” elided the interconnection between the two, and as Igo\n",
    "notes, this distinction “did not lead them to an understanding of ‘contemporary American culture’\n",
    "as built upon certain groups’ systematic exclusion from it.”14\n",
    "The systematic exclusion of minority groups from mainstream culture was the raison\n",
    "d’etre of another presence in 1920s Muncie: the Ku Klux Klan. Because the Lynds overlooked\n",
    "white Protestant exclusivity as a central feature of Muncie’s cultural life, they were not able to\n",
    "develop a coherent framework with which they might understand the role of the Klan in civic\n",
    "society. Middletown’s chapter on “The Organization of Leisure” includes statistics on the\n",
    "business and working class husbands and wives’ membership in clubs and lodges and a footnote\n",
    "acknowledges the Klan’s qualification as a lodge, yet the chapter’s discussion of groups like the\n",
    "Rotary Club, Masons, and YMCA never extends into the inner sanctums of the Klan.15 The Klan\n",
    "does receive cursory treatment in the book’s final chapter, “Engaging in Community Activities,”\n",
    "as an example of a phenomenon of “Things Unmaking Group Solidarity,” but it is inaccurately\n",
    "portrayed as a “tornado” with a “brief career” in Muncie, and therefore not significant enough to\n",
    "disqualify Muncie based on the criterion mentioned above as a town without “any outstanding\n",

    "Americans that transcended class barriers. In The Second Coming of the KKK, Linda Gordon\n",
    "chronicles the Klan’s tradition of hosting large festive carnivals that welcomed families of all\n",
    "types: “[Klan pageants were] typically staged in the summer, often on Independence Day, and\n",
    "outdoors...Open to everyone, located in fairgrounds, public parks, and donated private fields,\n",
    "they were announced in newspapers, handbills, and posters tied to trees far enough in advance\n",
    "that word spread widely.” As “family affairs” featuring “respectable entertainment and\n",
    "participatory activities for people of all ages” like music, ball games, and hot air balloon rides,\n",
    "Klonvocations attracted up to tens of thousands of attendees, and often converted leisure-seekers\n",
    "into members of the order. Gordon cites the Klan’s reported numbers of “mass naturalizations” at\n",
    "their pageants: 4,560 initiates at a 1922 Chicago event; 7,000 in Dayton in 1923. While she\n",
    "includes a caveat-- “no doubt these are exaggerated figures”-- this presentation of the Klansponsored leisure events as both an enticing locus of entertainment and a welcoming entry point\n",

    "institution.20The Klan was of course an exclusive club that thrived on the marginalization of nonmembers, but within its ranks, white Protestants of a variety of backgrounds socialized and\n",
    "networked peaceably.\n",
    "In a similar vein, Middletown treated religious practice as a bland, ideologically empty\n",

    "they reported that “[interviewees] inclined at first to think the questioner was joking, a condition\n",

    "majority of citizens’ nominal adherence to the Christian faith and their conflicting theologies and\n",
    "spotty records of church attendance. Again, the Lynds turned to statistics to prove their findings:\n",
    "Although the tradition is that “everyone goes to church,” a check of attendance at the services of the\n",
    "forty-two religious bodies during the four-week period from October 26 to November 22, 1924, shows\n",
    "that an average of only eleven males in each 100 of the white male population and eighteen females in\n",
    "each of 100 white female population attended Sunday morning church services on each of the four\n",
    "Sundays.22\n",
    "The Klan was mentioned in this section as a factor that kept people away from church. One\n",
    "parent suggested that the Klan tainted the meaning of Protestantism: “I used to be Catholic and\n",
    "wish I’d brought my children up Catholics since this Klan disturbance.” Another interviewee\n",
    "resented sharing their church with Klansmen: “This church over here is just full of Klan\n",
    "members, and I just ain’t got any use of the Klan.” Regarding a third resident the Lynds simply\n",
    "wrote, “And one is kept from the Catholic church by fear of the Klan.”23\n",
    "One aspect of religious life that Middletown did not consider was the spiritual nature of\n",
    "the Klan itself. While the Klan was a force that drove Catholics as well as resistant Protestants\n",
    "away from church, it also catalyzed its own members’ church attendance and engagement in\n",

    "changes in the life of the Muncie citizen catalyzed by the rapid industrialization of the previous\n",
    "thirty-five years. In the introduction to their study, the Lynds explained that they were interested\n",
    "in comparing the contemporary conditions and statistics of life in Middletown with those of\n",
    "1890. They provided this rationale: “The year 1890 was selected as the base-line against which\n",
    "to project the culture of today..because not until the end of 1886 was natural gas struck in the city\n",
